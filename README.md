# Butterflow
## What it can do:
1. Make **motion interpolated videos**, increase a video's frame rate by rendering new frames based on motion (*uses a combination of pixel-warping and blending*).
2. Make **smooth motion videos** (*simple blending between frames*).
3. Leverage interpolated frames to make **fluid slow motion videos**.

## How it works:
BF works by rendering intermediate frames between existing frames using a process called [motion interpolation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_interpolation). For example, given two existing frames, `A` and `B`, this program can generate frames `C.1`, `C.2`...`C.n` that are positioned between the two. In contrast to other tools that can only *blend or dupe* frames, this program *warps pixels based on motion* to generate new ones.

BF uses these interpolated frames to increase a video's frame rate, which can give the perception of smoother motion and more fluid animation, an effect that most people know as the "soap opera effect".

Here's a demo of BF leveraging motion interpolation to make a fluid slow motion video:

In this example, BF has slowed a [`1s` video](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/103239050/ba12a4b.mp4) down by `10x`. An additional `270` frames were interpolated from `30` original source frames giving the video a smooth feel during playback. The same video was slowed down with FFmpeg alone (shown on the right-hand side), but because it dupes frames and can't interpolate new ones, the video has a noticeable stutter.

Here's another example of the same concept. Frame-stepping through the BF'd file would make the interpolated frames, marked `Int: Y`, more evident.

## How to install:
**Important:** BF only works on 64-bit systems.

* **Mac OS X:** With [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/), `brew install homebrew/science/butterflow`.
* **Windows (Portable)**: Download [butterflow-0.2.2.7z](http://srv.dthpham.me/butterflow/releases/win/butterflow-0.2.2.7z).
  * Sha256: cb228ea8674f6ff29573c4f0b00a0ff513420021b51648ed6aad3099505f0ba5
* **Arch Linux:** A package is available in the AUR under [`butterflow`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/butterflow/).
* **From Source (Ubuntu, Debian):** Refer to the [Install From Source Guide](https://github.com/dthpham/butterflow/blob/master/docs/Install-From-Source-Guide.md) for instructions.

## Setup (for Linux users):
**Note:** No setup is necessary on OS X or Windows. Read [this](https://github.com/dthpham/butterflow/blob/master/docs/Setting-Up-OpenCL.md#os-x-mavericks-and-newer) if you run into a problem with OpenCL on OS X.

BF requires no additional setup to use, however it's too slow out of the box to do any serious work. You must set up a functional OpenCL environment on your machine to take advantage of hardware accelerated methods that will make rendering significantly faster.

See: [Setting up OpenCL](https://github.com/dthpham/butterflow/blob/master/docs/Setting-Up-OpenCL.md) for details on how to do this.

## Usage:
Run `butterflow -h` for a full list of options. See: [Example Usage](https://github.com/dthpham/butterflow/blob/master/docs/Example-Usage.md) for typical commands.
